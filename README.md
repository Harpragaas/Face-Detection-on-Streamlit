# Face-Detection-on-Streamlit


This is a simple face detection app used on streamlit. 

The app uses "Haar Cascade Classifier" for face detection. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images which is then used to detect objects in other images.

The app uses "DeepFace" to detect your current emotion, gender, age and race. DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook.

### Files Details: 

1. app.py - This is the main python file used to create the application. 

2. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml- Downloaded from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data, where the haarcascade folder contains trained classifiers for detecting objects of a particular type, e.g. faces (frontal, profile), pedestrians etc.
              

### Update :

Currently streamlit is still developing a way in which the application can suuport the use of webcam. Streamlit doesn’t currently have any browser-based camera support, so this isn’t possible right now. However, I will provide a screen capture on how the interface will look like.
